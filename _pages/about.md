Hi! I'm Daniel Maganto, a Senior DevOps Engineer with 12+ years of experience. I'm passionate about streamlining workflows and empowering developers through automation and cloud technologies. I specialize in implementing infrastructure as code (Terraform), building CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, Tekton), and managing containerized applications with Kubernetes. Throughout my career, I've helped companies to migrate to the cloud, automate deployments, and reduce infrastructure costs. I'm also a firm believer in open source and had contributed to various projects.

Experience at companies such as Allianz Direct, ING, Orange Espa√±a, StratioBD, among others.
